Author: Tracy Shen

Date: Sunday, March 22nd, 2015

This README.md file is composed to describe how the run_analysis.R script works based on the requirement from the course project: https://class.coursera.org/getdata-012/human_grading/view/courses/973499/assessments/3/submissions

In order to run the script "run_analysis.R", you need to have some preparation. They are (based on what i personally used):

R Version: R version 3.1.3 (2015-03-09) -- "Smooth Sidewalk" (Other Version should work as well)

Platform: Windows 7 professional x86_64-w64-mingw32/x64 (64-bit) (Mac or other platforms should work as well)

RStudio: RStudio-0.98.1091. It's an R console to write and run R codes more intuitively  (Other version should work as well).

R Packages: dplyr and gdata additional packages are required to install in order to run the codes. 

Raw Data: it's provided by the course project and can be downloaded from here: https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip
It includes the below files:
- 'README.txt'

- 'features_info.txt': Shows information about the variables used on the feature vector.

- 'features.txt': List of all features.

- 'activity_labels.txt': Links the class labels with their activity name.

- 'train/X_train.txt': Training set.

- 'train/y_train.txt': Training labels.

- 'test/X_test.txt': Test set.

- 'test/y_test.txt': Test labels.

Text editor: Notepad++ is used to view and observe the data that originally came in as ".txt" file. It's opted than Notepad becaused it can provide better experience of viewing subject and activity as well as the feature file.
